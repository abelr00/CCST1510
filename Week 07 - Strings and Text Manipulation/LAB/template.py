# =================================================================== FUNCTIONS
# 1. Write parse_line(raw_line) that cleans and parses one raw, messy line
#    into a dict. Handle inconsistent spacing and case - that is the whole
#    point of this week.
#
#    Typical and above: also write status_of(...), shaped for your lane
#    (e.g. OVER LIMIT / WARNING / OK, or FLAGGED / OK). Give both a
#    one-line docstring.

def parse_line(raw_line):
    """Clean one messy Cyber record and return a dictionary of parsed values."""
    line = raw_line.strip()

    # Split once at the first comma so the source IP is separated cleanly.
    source_part, remainder = line.split(",", 1)
    source_ip = source_part.strip().lower()

    # Convert pieces like "failed_logins=12" and "total_attempts=400" to floats.

# ====================================================================== INPUT
# 2. Your raw, messy records - at least 5, deliberately varied in spacing
#    and case. Match the shape to your lane:
#
#    AI / Data Science : "  Survey_2026 , rating=4 , age=23  "
#    Cyber Security     : "SRC=10.0.0.5,ATTEMPTS=12,RESULT=FAILED"
#    IT                  : "  Srv-01 , used=87 , total=100  "
#
#    Excellent: save these lines to a file and load them with open() /
#    a for loop over the file, instead of writing them directly here.

raw_records = []  
with open("cyber_messy_records.txt", "r", encoding="utf-8") as file:

# =============================================================== PROCESS + OUTPUT
# 3. Parse and report on every record.
#
#    Threshold : parse each record, print the cleaned dict.
#    Typical   : also call status_of(...) for each, print it alongside.
#    Excellent : print a one-line summary at the end - how many records,
#                how many flagged.

for raw_record in raw_records:
    try:
        record = parse_line(raw_record)
    except ValueError:
        print(f"Could not parse: {raw_record}")
        continue

    total_records += 1
    status = status_of(record)

    if status != "OK":
        flagged_count += 1

    print(f"{record['source_ip']} -> {record} | {status}")

print()
print(f"Summary: {total_records} records checked, {flagged_count} flagged.")


# ==========================================================================
# 4. Before you finish:
#
#    [ ] Run it against at least 5 genuinely messy raw records
#    [ ] Run it with a value that will not convert to a number - write the
#        error down
#    [ ] Check every function does one job, with a docstring
